This tab effectively communicates crime frequency of different crime types in relation to the socio-economic status of community areas in Chicago. For each type, it displays a bar chart of the top five community areas, ranked by the number of reported crimes. These areas are ordered from left to right based on their average per capita income, with the wealthiest community areas appearing on the left and the less affluent on the right. This layout allows for an intuitive comparison and clearly illustrates the correlation between a community's wealth and its crime rate. The gradient color fill of each bar represents the average income itself, providing a visual cue of the economic status within each community area. This visualization serves as a powerful tool for identifying patterns and informing policy decisions related to crime prevention and resource allocation based on economic factors.
