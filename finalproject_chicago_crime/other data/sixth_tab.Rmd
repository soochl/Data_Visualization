This tab enables users to select specific police districts and crime types from 2020 to 2023 and displays them on the map. It features a bar chart created with Plotly that visualizes the distances between crime locations and their nearest police stations, categorizing them into different distance ranges. Users can choose one or multiple police districts and crime types.  
Although the distribution of crime distances varies across police districts, crimes tend to occur less frequently near police stations. These findings can inform decisions about whether additional police stations are needed in certain areas to deter crimes that are more likely to occur farther from existing stations.
