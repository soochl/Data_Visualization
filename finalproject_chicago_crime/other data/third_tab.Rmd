This Shiny tab provides an interactive visualization of crime frequencies over time in Chicago. This interactive feature allows users to select a specific crime type from the top 10 lists, and the scatter plot is generated, illustrating the frequency of that particular crime throughout the years. A general declining trend is observed in most crime types, consistent with overall crime rate trends during these periods. Notably, Crime Trespass” dropped out of the top 10 crime types in Chicago after 2006, while “Weapon Violation” appeared as a primary crime type starting in 2020.
