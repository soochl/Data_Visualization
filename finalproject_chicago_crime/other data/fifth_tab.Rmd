The goal of this page was to dig into crime trends in Chicago among a number of factors, and design an app that allows a user to draw conclusions about certain crime trends in a specific time or location.   
This section compares crime rates by Community Area. Chicago is divided up into Community Areas (neighborhoods), each having its own unique trends and demographics.  
Using the selection field, users can choose which Community Areas they want to compare. Once a (or multiple) Community Areas are selected, two visualizations will pop up. On top, a line chart that shows the overall crime rates in that specific community area from 2020-2024. Below, a stacked bar chart that visualizes the proportional demographics of that community area (showing the % white, black, asian, and hispanic population). Users can draw further conclusions and analyze how the racial makeup of a particular community area might influence and impact the crime rateâ€”specifically as it relates to patterns of discriminatory policing and institutional racism.
