This tab is designed to explore the temporal and geographical relationships between crimes and bars. Users can select specific types of crimes (e.g. battery, assault, criminal damage, robbery, sex offense, homicide, stalking, and liquor law violations) that occurred in public areas potentially influenced by alcohol use. By choosing a specific time period, users can analyze whether these crimes are more likely to occur during the day or at night. A bar chart displays the distances between crime scenes and the nearest bars, enabling users to identify which bars are associated with a higher likelihood of nearby crimes. This information assists local authorities in enhancing surveillance around certain bars to reduce crime rates in those areas.  
Note: To ensure the Shiny App functions correctly, only data from selected sampling bars and four police districts are displayed.
